# A custom Library that can parse and evaluate Mathematical functions accepted as strings  

* First, the input string is Tokenized into meaningful components using a Lexer.   
* The Token sequence is converted into an Abstract Syntax Tree that represents the function's structure using  
a parser
* The Tree is traversed to evaluate the function  

| Lexer | 
---------
The Lexer recognizes 4 different kinds of Tokens:  
  * Variable 'x'  
  * Decimal numerals
  * Parantheses
  * Elementary functions (sin, cos, ln, etc)


| Parser |  
----------
The parser scans through the linked list of lexical tokens generated by our lexer and
derives a dynamic array of elements arranged in Reverse Polish Notation (postfix nota
tion).  

The shunting yard algorithm is employed to achieve this task.
