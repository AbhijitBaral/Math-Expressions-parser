# A custom Library that can parse and evaluate Mathematical functions accepted as strings  

-
Aim is to write a number of functions that can do a number of things:  

*Lexer-> Tokenizes the string and stores the tokens in a linked list sequenced according to the 
 corresponding tokens in the input string.  
*rpnArrayParser-> Parses the token list and generates a dynamic array of tokens arranged according
to the Reverse Polish Notation.  
*rpnASTparser-> Parses the token list and generates an Abstract Syntax Tree of tokens.  
*rpnArrayEval-> Evaluates the RPN Array generated by rpnArrayParser and returns a decimal value.  
*rpnASTeval-> Evaluates the Abstract Syntax Tree generated by rpnASTparser and returns a decimal value.  

Each of the above functions can be used independently with the appropriate headers defined. 

* First, the input string is Tokenized into meaningful components using a Lexer.   
* The Token sequence is converted into an Abstract Syntax Tree that represents the function's structure using  
a parser
* The Tree is traversed to evaluate the function  

| Lexer | 
---------
token *lex(char *inputString);  

The Lexer recognizes 4 different kinds of Tokens:  
  * Variable 'x'  
  * Decimal numerals
  * Parantheses
  * Elementary functions (sin, cos, ln, etc)


| rpnArrayParser |  
------------------
Stack *parser(token *linkedlistHead);  

The parser scans through the linked list of lexical tokens generated by our lexer and
derives a dynamic array of elements arranged in Reverse Polish Notation (postfix nota
tion).  

The shunting yard algorithm is employed to achieve this task.
